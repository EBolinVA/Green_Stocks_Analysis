refactor script for stock analysis
## Overview of VBA Refactoring Challenge

A friend, Steve, asked for help analyzing a variety of green stocks for his parents. I started with an Excel file of the stock data he wants help analyzing. To get the most out of Excel, I used Visual Basic for Applications to automate some of the tasks instead of manually duplicating excel formulas over a very large spreadsheet. Along the way I learned several coding techniques, called macros or subroutines, to run the analysis more efficiently.

## Green Stocks Analysis Results

Steve provided an Excel file with two worksheets containing data for the 12 stocks. Each worksheet (named "2017" and "2018") had daily records over the course of a year for opening price, closing price, and volume traded.
